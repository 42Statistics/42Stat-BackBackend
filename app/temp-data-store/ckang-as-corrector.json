Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defense.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, except for cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject before starting the defense.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, except for cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

      "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject before starting the defense.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, except for cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defense, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0.

Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence.

Take the time to discuss and debate the\n  problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities.

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project and also\n  check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you and\n  make you evaluate something other than the content of the official\n  repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the correcting\n  and the corrected students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the correcting student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the entire\n  subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty\n  repository, non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc.\n  In these cases, the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or\n  -42 in case of cheating). However, with the exception of cheating,\n    you are encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you\n    have not finished it) in order to identify any issues that may\n    have caused this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in\n    the future.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

      "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

However, with the exception of cheating, you are\nencouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\nfinished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\nthis failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\nno other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\ntermination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\nappropriate flag. \nYou should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\nIf you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \nevaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\nbe properly freed before the end of execution.\nYou are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\nleaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n\n- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must\n  be properly freed before the end of execution.\n  You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as\n  leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n",

Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n",

However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n",

The well-being of the community\n  depends on it.\n\n- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual\n  dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss\n  and debate the problems you have identified.\n\n- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your\n  peers might have understood the project's instructions and the\n  scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade\n  him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and\n  only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.\n",

      "guidelines_md": "- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's\n  GiT repository.\n\n- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student\n  or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project\n  and also check that \"git clone\" is used in an empty folder.\n\n- Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you\n  and make you evaluate something other than the content of the\n  official repository.\n\n- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating\n  and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used\n  to facilitate the grading.\n\n- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular\n  project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the\n  entire subject prior to starting the defence.\n\n- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,\n  non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,\n  the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of\n  cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are\n  encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not\n  finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused\n  this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.\n\n- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,\n  no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected\n  termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the\n  appropriate flag. \n  You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.\n  If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the \n  evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.\n",
